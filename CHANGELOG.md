# Changelog

## [1.1.5] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **loadStats retry loop ran 10× even on success** — `loadStats()` returned
  `undefined` (bare `return;`) on success. The startup retry loop tested
  `while (!loaded)` — `!undefined === true` — so it kept retrying even after
  `/api/stats` had been successfully fetched and the DOM updated.
  Fix: `loadStats()` now returns `true` on success and `false` on error.
  The internal 5-attempt retry inside `loadStats()` was also removed — the
  outer IIFE loop already handles retries, no duplication needed.
- **aria2 dot slow to appear** — `checkConnections()` was started only after
  the `loadStats` retry loop finished. Now it fires immediately at startup
  parallel to the stats retry, so the aria2 dot appears as soon as the
  aria2 test resolves.

## [1.1.4] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Root cause of all dashboard loading failures found and fixed** —
  Browser console showed:
  `Uncaught ReferenceError: async is not defined  (line 2544)`
  A stray `async ` fragment on its own line (between two function definitions)
  caused the browser to interpret it as an expression statement referencing
  an undefined variable `async`. This threw a `ReferenceError` that aborted
  the **entire script** before any function was defined or any IIFE ran.
  Result: no API calls, no DOM updates, no sidebar dots — only nav() onclick
  handlers worked because the browser had partially parsed the script before
  crashing (function declarations are hoisted, but the runtime error stopped
  the IIFE). Clicking any nav item re-triggered loadStats() which succeeded.
  Fix: removed the stray `async ` line.

## [1.1.3] — 2026-04-19

### Changed
- **Startup: debug status panel** — a small status strip appears below the stat cards
  on page load, showing each step of the startup sequence in real time
  (script start → settings → loadStats attempts → success/failure).
  This panel auto-hides after 10 seconds once stats are loaded, and helps
  diagnose why values were not appearing. The startup sequence is now a
  simple awaited loop (up to 10 attempts) instead of a detached background poller.

## [1.1.2] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Dashboard empty on load — definitive fix** — replaced the retry-loop approach
  with a persistent background poller (`pollUntilLoaded`) that runs independently
  of the startup `await` chain. The poller fires immediately and retries `loadStats()`
  with growing delays (400ms → 800ms → … → max 3s) until it succeeds, then
  triggers `loadRecent()`, `checkConnections()`, and `checkPremiumStatus()`.
  This means:
  - The startup `await` only blocks for `api('/settings')` (~50ms) and then
    `renderTopbarActions()`. Everything else is truly non-blocking.
  - If the server is slow on first request (DB warmup, etc.), the poller
    keeps retrying silently in the background until data arrives — no user
    interaction required.
  - `loadStats()` simplified back to a single attempt (returns `true`/`false`).
    Retry logic lives in the poller, not in `loadStats()` itself.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **UI values empty on load (root cause found and fixed)** —
  `loadStats()` had no retry logic: if `/api/stats` failed or timed out on the
  first request (common right after container start while the DB connection is
  being established), the `catch` block silently discarded the error and the
  dashboard stayed blank. The user had to click elsewhere to trigger a second
  call that succeeded. Fixed:
  - `loadStats()` now retries up to **5 times** with increasing delays
    (500 ms → 1 s → 1.5 s → 2 s). On permanent failure it sets the
    AllDebrid dot to red and logs to console.
  - **Safety-net setTimeout**: 3 seconds after startup, checks whether
    `s-total` is still blank and triggers a fresh `loadStats()` if so.
  - **Sidebar dots** are set to yellow "checking…" immediately on startup
    (before any API call) so the user sees active feedback, not stale defaults.
  - `checkConnections()` simplified: AllDebrid + DB dots are already set by
    `loadStats()`; `checkConnections()` now only handles the **aria2** dot,
    with up to **3 retries** (800 ms apart) before marking it as offline.

### Added
- `.dot.check` CSS now pulses (animation) to communicate "actively checking".
- `.dot.warn` CSS (yellow, no pulse) for "not configured" states.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Dashboard still empty on first load** — settings and stats now load truly in
  parallel (`Promise.allSettled`). Previously `await api('/settings')` ran first,
  blocking `loadStats()` and delaying all visible data by the settings round-trip.
  Now both fire simultaneously; dashboard numbers appear as soon as `/api/stats` responds.
- **FlexGet scheduler silently broken** — `flexget_loop` called `run_flexget_tasks_with_retry`
  which was removed in v1.0.9. Every scheduled run threw a `NameError` and was silently
  swallowed. Fixed: scheduler now calls `run_flexget_tasks` directly.
- **FlexGet does not detect task completion** — `_poll_execution` treated HTTP 404
  on the queue URL as "try next URL", looping until timeout. In FlexGet v3 the queue
  entry is deleted when a task completes, so 404 means done. Fixed: two consecutive
  404s on the queue URL are now treated as successful completion.
- **FlexGet task timeout too short** — hardcoded 300s (5 min) caused long-running
  tasks (indexer updates, large RSS feeds) to time out prematurely.

### Added
- `flexget_task_timeout_seconds` config field (default: 0 = 3600s = 1h).
  Configurable in Settings → FlexGet → "Task timeout". Set higher for very long tasks.

## [1.0.9] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Dashboard still empty on first load** — `checkPremiumStatus()` was `await`ed
  in the startup sequence, blocking all rendering until the AllDebrid API responded
  (1–3s). Changed to fire-and-forget alongside `loadRecent()` and `checkConnections()`.
  Only `loadStats()` is awaited — it populates the dashboard in ~100ms.
- **FlexGet webhook returns HTTP 400 on Discord URLs** — the webhook sent a generic
  JSON payload (`{"event": "...", "source": "flexget"}`) which Discord rejects.
  Fixed: Discord URLs are auto-detected and the payload is formatted as a proper
  Discord embed (`{"embeds": [{"title": ..., "color": ..., "fields": [...]}]}`).
  Non-Discord URLs still receive the raw JSON payload.
  4xx responses from the webhook endpoint now log a WARNING with the response body.

### Changed
- **Per-task FlexGet webhooks removed** — replaced by a single optional FlexGet
  webhook URL in Settings → FlexGet. When empty, falls back to the Discord webhook
  from Settings → Discord. All events (run_started, task_started, task_ok,
  task_error, run_finished, server_unreachable, server_recovered) go through
  one configurable endpoint.

## [1.0.8] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Dashboard values only appear after first click** — root causes:
  1. `loadStats()` set the DB dot but not the AllDebrid dot; added `setDot('api','ok')` 
     directly in `loadStats()` so AllDebrid is green immediately when stats load
  2. Startup awaited `checkConnections()` (slow: includes `test-aria2` POST) before 
     showing any data; changed to fire-and-forget so stats render first
  3. `loadRecent()` now also runs fire-and-forget alongside `loadStats()`
- **Per-task webhook editor shows JS code as visible text** — root cause:
  `oninput="...split(',')..."` — the single quote inside `split(',')` broke the 
  HTML attribute, leaving `).map(function(e){...})` as literal visible text.
  Fixed by rebuilding `renderFgTaskWebhooks()` using DOM API (`createElement`, 
  `oninput` as JS property) instead of HTML string concatenation — no escaping issues.
- Per-task webhook hint clarified: URL is optional, falls back to global FlexGet webhook

## [1.0.7] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **UI values only visible after first click** — `settingsData` defensive null-guard
  in startup; `loadStats()` guards against null settingsData; `checkConnections()`
  shows `aria2: not configured` (warn dot) instead of blank when aria2 URL is empty
- **FlexGet webhook silent** — webhook calls now log at INFO level (previously DEBUG
  only, invisible in normal logs); webhook failures log at WARNING; added INFO log
  at the start of each FlexGet run showing task list and triggered_by

## [1.0.6] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- `fgTaskWebhooks` TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone) error: "can't access lexical declaration
  before initialization" — caused by JS functions and `let` declaration landing
  inside the `innerHTML` template literal instead of the script scope.
  Fixed by:
  - Moving declaration to top-level with `var` (hoisted, no TDZ)
  - Placing all helper functions in script scope before `checkFlexgetRunning`
  - Rewriting `renderFgTaskWebhooks` without template literals in onclick
    attributes (avoids scope issues in inline event handlers)

## [1.0.5] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- Per-task FlexGet webhooks (`flexget_task_webhooks_json`)
  - Each task can have its own webhook URL and event filter
  - Events: task_started, task_ok, task_error (empty = all)
  - Falls back to global FlexGet webhook for unconfigured tasks
  - UI editor in Settings → FlexGet
- Task overlap prevention: per-task asyncio.Lock prevents the same task
  from running more than once simultaneously (skipped runs logged + persisted)
- `GET /flexget/running` endpoint — returns list of currently executing tasks
- `POST /flexget/run/{task_name}` endpoint — run a single task directly
  - Returns HTTP 409 if task is already running
- Sidebar FlexGet indicator now shows task names while running
- `task_started` webhook event fired before each task execution

### Fixed
- flexget.py: removed duplicate function definitions left by Codex merge
- `checkFlexgetRunning` now uses `/flexget/running` (real-time) instead of history
- `flexgetRunSingleTask` uses `/flexget/run/{task}` endpoint + handles 409

## [1.0.4] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- FlexGet schedule editor: white circle/dot above Remove button completely eliminated
  by replacing .ttrack toggle with inline-styled toggle (no ::after pseudo-element
  outside its container)
- flexgetRunSingleTask: was missing async keyword

### Added
- Run button per task directly in the schedule editor row
- FlexGet retry on unreachable: waits flexget_retry_delay_minutes (default 5),
  retries once, then sends server_unreachable webhook event
- server_recovered webhook event when FlexGet becomes reachable again after failure
- State deduplication: unreachable/recovered webhooks only fire on state change
- flexget_retry_delay_minutes config field (0 = disabled)
- Retry delay setting visible in Settings → FlexGet

## [1.0.3] — 2026-04-19

UI polish, FlexGet status indicator, Progressbar fix, Webhook fallback.

### Added
- FlexGet running indicator in sidebar (pulsing dot while tasks execute)
- Discord community link under Project in the sidebar
- Progressbar: animated stripe for downloading torrents with no percentage yet

### Changed
- FlexGet webhook and Reporting webhook now fall back to the main Discord
  webhook when no dedicated URL is configured
- FlexGet task schedule Remove button styled correctly (red border, no white circle)

### Fixed
- Progressbar: `prog-fill` now renders correctly (`display:block`, `min-width:0`)
- Progressbar: `completed` torrents always show 100% in green
- Progressbar: `downloading` torrents with 0% show an animated stripe instead of empty bar
